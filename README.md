# Project 3: Around The U.S.

### Overview  

* Intro  
* Figma  
* Images  
  
**Intro**
  
This project is made so all the elements are displayed correctly on popular screen sizes. We recommend investing more time in completing this project, since it's more difficult than previous ones.  
  
**Figma**  
  
* [Link to the project on Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/ii4xxsJ0ghevUOcssTlHZv/Sprint-3%3A-Around-the-US?node-id=0%3A1)  
  
**Images**  
  
The way you'll do this at work is by exporting images directly from Figma â€” we recommend doing that to practice more. Don't forget to optimize them [here](https://tinypng.com/), so your project loads faster. 
  
Good luck and have fun!

Hi, my name is Khuephamy Phialoung. I am a Practicum student, this project is called
 se_project_abouttheus, so it requires us to create the layouts for the webpage according to the designed on Figma. In this project I implemented media queries to make the different layouts depending on the screen size. Grid is one of the most that have been used in this project, I use grid to set the profile and cards to changes it position depend of the screen, so in this situation grid is better and easier to use than using flexbox.
